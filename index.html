    <h1>The Russia-Ukraine Conflict and its Roots in National Identity</h1>
    
    <p>Ukraine has endured an unstable political era and weak economy since its 
      dissolution from the USSR, but the essence of many domestic and 
      foreign policy decisions stem from the presence of a national identity that 
      often <a href="https://www.husj.harvard.edu/articles/language-status-and-state-loyalty-in-ukraine">
        wavers between the side of Russia and that of the rest of Europe.</a> </p>

    <p>Language in Ukraine is a key factor. In 2012, Russian was established in Ukraine as 
      a regional language, a decision that in part attempted to combat the polarizing national 
      elections in the 90s and 2000s. The law was seen to have removed incentive to learn 
      Ukrainian and incited Ukrainians to perpetuate the notion that Russian-speaking 
      Ukrainians were products of <a href="https://www.husj.harvard.edu/articles/language-status-and-state-loyalty-in-ukraine">
        withstanding Russian and Soviet policies.</a></p>

    <p>These recent decisions—which, this one in particular was sought to be repealed before the repeal bill was vetoed—reflect a direct link between the Ukrainian language and the country’s sense of nationalism and loyalty, and in turn, influences responses to the conflict at hand.</p>

    <p>A 2018 Harvard Ukranian Studies essay by Associate Professor Dominique Arel at the University of Ottawa’s School of Political Studies explains a particular case in the phenomenon of reidentification and shifts in national identity in Ukraine:</p>
    <p>“The significant decrease in the number of ethnic Russians in the 2001 census… provided indirect evidence to that effect. The decrease was partly attributable to outmigration (mainly to Russia), but also, most likely to a significant extent, to ethnic reidentification from Russian to Ukrainian, which itself may have been significantly intergenerational; that is, children of ethnically mixed households who may have been likely to identify as Russian in the 1989 census were more likely to identify as Ukrainian in 2001. The increase in the proportion of ethnic Ukrainians claiming Russian as a language of origin between 1989 and 2001 (from 11.7 to 14.1 percent), instead of denoting greater linguistic assimilation, may be explained by the greater propensity of individuals of Russian language of origin to identify as Ukrainian under conditions of Ukrainian state independence.”</p>
    <p>State loyalty and identity is crucial to the conversation of the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, which dates back to Feb 2014. Mutual tension and growing unease has been harbored by their governments and civilians since, and there are significant connections to explored between Ukraine’s Russian and Russian-speaking population and how this influences the conflict on both sides.</p>

    <p>Remarks of positivity have predictably dwindled in both countries since the beginning of the war. Whether this strain on public opinion is despite or a consequence of the relationship the nations had before the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, is the question to be asked. Russians had also harbored fluctuating public perceptions of Ukraine even prior to the above graph, with significant dips seen as early as 2009.</p>

    <p>Of course, Russia is still the third country down on the list of neighboring nations Ukrainian refugees have fled to since Feb 2022 due to its proximity.  The influx of Ukrainian refugees into other neighboring countries will leave a social and political mark in the Slavic region. 
      <a href="https://www.husj.harvard.edu/articles/language-status-and-state-loyalty-in-ukraine">The democratic weight of languages</a> has major effects, and countries like Poland may witness certain demographic and social transformations, too.</p>

    <p>Currently, many countries straddle a similar rope to Ukraine: keeping on reasonably mild terms with Russia or choosing to impose ample restrictions as the U.S. has—a decision that would align any similar actor with American interests. As other actors develop their respective responses to Russia’s actions, the world’s eyes will remain on Ukraine.</p>
